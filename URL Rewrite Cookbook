To use URL Rewrite you need following - 
1.	HWC buildpack support 
  a.	HWC buildpack support was there prior to 2.0 but before that there was no PASW earlier
  b.	Ever since PASW is available the HWC buildpack support always existed 
2.	DLL in the container - comes from root FS

Ideal option 
Move to 1709 before using URL rewrite module. This is because the 1709 image by default includes the 
required DLL and is part of the container root FS.

Not ideal option
If you for some reason can’t move to 1709 and have to stay with 2012R2 and would like to test URL rewrite 
module then following needs to happen.  
Download the MSI from here. (This is the MSI used in 1709 root FS)
Option 1 - Manual 
1.	Create test PCF environment 
2.	RDP into the Windows cell 
3.	Install the Rewrite URL module MSI on the host
4.	Restage your application 
5.	Repeat this for every Windows cell where the app is going to run . 
You can use this option to try the URL Rewrite feature, but will not recommend to go to prod with this. 
Challenge with this option is if platform is repaved or BOSH replenishes the VM then the changes will be lost. 

Option 2 - Automated
1.	Create a BOSH add-on. A sample Windows add-on can be found here. (Altoros can help you create the BOSH add-on)
2.	Add a job that installs URL Rewrite module MSI on every Windows VM
This option can help you go to prod. However, if you plan to move to 1709 it doesn’t make sense to invest in 
creating the BOSH add-on.
